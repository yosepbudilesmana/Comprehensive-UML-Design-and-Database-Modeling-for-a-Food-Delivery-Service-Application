# Comprehensive UML Design and Database Modeling for a Food Delivery Service Application- by Yosep Budi Lesmana

## 📘 Project Description
This repository contains **detailed UML diagrams and database models** for a food delivery service application. The goal is to represent the system's architecture, interactions, and data structure in a visual and structured manner to facilitate effective system planning and development.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide a comprehensive visual representation of the application’s components.
- Model the interactions between users, services, and data flows.
- Design an efficient and scalable database schema to support food ordering, delivery, and management.

## 🧩 Key Components
### 📊 UML Diagrams:
- **Use Case Diagram** – Illustrates user interactions with the system.
- **Class Diagram** – Defines system classes, attributes, and relationships.
- **Sequence Diagram** – Represents the flow of messages between objects.
- **Activity Diagram** – Visualizes workflows and processes within the application.

### 🗄️ Database Design:
- **ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)** – Models entities like Users, Restaurants, Orders, and Deliveries.
- **Normalized Tables** – Ensures data integrity and reduces redundancy.
- **Relational Mapping** – Establishes relationships between entities for efficient querying.

## 📁 Repository Structure (suggested)


## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Draw.io /StarUML** for diagram creation
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL** for database modeling
- **DB Designer / dbdiagram.io** for ERD design

## 🚀 Use Cases
- Serve as a blueprint for developing a food delivery application.
- Educational reference for system design and modeling practices.
- Useful in team communication and stakeholder presentations.
